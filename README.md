# PD2-Filters
 Compilation of PD2 filters based on the launcher list

 This is intended mostly to be a backup and/or a resource for users with launcher issues or wanting to avoid the launcher.
 Descriptions of filters will not be included.

 Find the filter you would like to use in the `filters` folder, download it and place the file in your PD2 folder.
